        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I’m a full-time front end developer with 2 years experience. In that time,  I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company.
            This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development</p>
